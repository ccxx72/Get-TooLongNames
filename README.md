# Get-TooLongNames
This function, named "Get-TooLongNames", has two parameters: a string called "Path" and a string called "OutputFile". It uses the "Get-ChildItem" cmdlet to retrieve all items in the specified path and its subdirectories, using the "-Recurse" parameter to search recursively. It then loops through each item using the "foreach" loop, and checks if the length of the item's full name (including the path) is greater than 250 characters. If it is, the item's name and full name length are displayed using the "Write-Host" cmdlet, and the item is appended to the output file specified in the "OutputFile" parameter. The length of the item's full name is also appended to the output file.
