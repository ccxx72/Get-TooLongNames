# Get-TooLongNames
The provided script is designed to scan a specified directory and its subdirectories recursively. It identifies file and folder paths that exceed a predefined character limit (250 characters in this case). For each excessively long path found, it records the name, full path, and length in characters. The script then exports this information into a CSV file, allowing for easy analysis and management of lengthy file and folder paths. The user can customize the input path and output file location as needed.
